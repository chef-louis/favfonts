## Project Details ## 

**Author Notes**

Fonts are hardcoded into the CSS file.

Some elements that are not implemented:
- Minor nav within Header does not take you anywhere
- Search field
- Add button within font cards

Other than that, see the checklist of requirements below:

**Requirements**

*Structure*
- [X] Header with minor navigation *(Logo and Catalog/Featured/Articles/About link list)*
- [X] Nav with Major navigation / page-manipulation *(search, custom text, font-size, dark/light mode, grid/list mode, and reset)*
- [X] Main section to contain the font cards
- [X] Font cards which display the Font Name, the sample text, and an add button
- [X] Footer section with your developer information

*Style*
- [X] Sample text in each card should be displayed in the corresponding font
- [X] Buttons/links should be evident *(make sure the cursor changes, etc.)*
- [X] Implement a way to handle overflow from sample text in font cards, as the font size is adjustable

*Functionality*
- [X] Text typed into the custom text (type something) box should immediately change the sample text displayed in each font card
- [X] The sample text should return to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input *(ex. input == "")*
- [X] Font size chooser should have at least four sizes and should immediately change the sample text font size in each font card
- [X] Implement the clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it should make the page appear as if the user reloaded the page *(do not actually reload the page)*

*Other*
- [X] Your repo needs to have a robust README.md
- [X] Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before submitting

**Extras (Not Required)**

- [ ] Include a back-to-top button that allows users to scroll to the top once the top of the page is out of view
- [ ] Make your design fully responsive *(small/large/portrait/landscape, etc.)*
- [X] Implement the light/dark mode toggle buttons
- [X] Implement the change display icon so you can flip between a grid and list layout for the font cards
